# PfDA_Project

*A creation of a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing*

## Problem Statement
1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ thedata set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### Set up

Applications used for completion of the tasks are [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [cmder](http://cmder.net/)

Distribution of the Python used is [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). 

###  How to run the code

1. Make sure that you have Python installed
2. Download or clone current repository "numpy.random"
3. Open Command Interpreter and naviagate to relevant directory
4. Run Jupyter notebook
5. On the home page of opened Jupyter server select PfDA- Assignment.ipynb
